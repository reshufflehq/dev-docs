Dev docs site of Reshuffle. Uses remark, rehype and prismjs to render markdown with syntax highlighting (even for JSX). Syntax style is directly borrowed from [ReactJS](reactjs.org).

Content management is possible using hidden `'/editor'` route. To use this route, the following env vars need to exist on deploy

```
JWT_HMAC_KEY= // !!!SECRET BACKEND ONLY!!! should be unique and secure, used to sign JWT. The HMAC is used for symmetric encryption of tokens, if it is leaked, your app is insecure.

REACT_APP_VALID_HOSTED_DOMAIN= // email address domain allowed for admins

REACT_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID= // https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2

REACT_APP_AUTH_NAME= // what is the name to display when asking for auth
```

> Note: When using Create-React-App any env-var starting with REACT_APP will be injected (permanently) into the client code

Once authenticated, posts can be created/updated using drop-down selection and correctly configured frontmatter.

Keywords: javascript, react, create-react-app, fullstack, bootstrap, backend, markdown, prism, remark, rehype, reactjs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
